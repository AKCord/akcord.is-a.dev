          Hey! I'm AKCord. I've loved computers ever since I was a kid, I
          discovered Discord bots at a pretty young age and I was amazed at how
          things worked back-end. At that time, I had no prior knowledge of
          programming languages, and that moment marked the beginning of my
          journey.
